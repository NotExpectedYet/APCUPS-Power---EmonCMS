# APCUPS - Power Collector for EmonCMS

# What does this do? 

# Why did I code it?

# How to install?

The script expects you've got apcupsd setup and running on a client. It can be windows or linux or whatever apcaccess currently supports but I've only detailed linux instructions below. 

## Clone the repo
`git clone https://github.com/NotExpectedYet/APCUPS-Power---EmonCMS`

## Change into the directory
`cd APCUPS-Power---EmonCMS/`

## Install the dependencies 
`npm ci`

## Create a file containing your emonCMS data.
